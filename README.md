Unsupervised Machine Learning on Cryptocurrencies

## Project Analysis

Raw data from 1200 cryptocurrencies were used for the analysis.  Considering only cryptocurrencies that are trading and removing null data points left 533 cryptocurrencies to be analyzed.  K value of 4 was discovered after reviewing the elbow curve results.  The BitTorrent cryptocurreny skewed visual results for 1 of the 4 clusters but remaining 3 provided insight into clustered cryptocurrencies based on ProofType and their supply and mined values.
